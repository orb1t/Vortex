# Vortex

An implementation of the _FHP model_ (with 6 velocity degrees of freedom),
based on _cellular automatons_, for the simulation of a 2D fluid. This model
can solve the _Navier-Stokes equation_ for an incompressible flow.

## Build

To build the project, it is necessary to have _Maven +3.5.0_, and
_Java SE 10 Release_ installed. Then, run:

```
$ mvn clean package
```

This will generate a _\*.jar_ in the root folder. If you find any issues with
the building, remove the _\*.jar_ files from the _Maven_ local repository
with:

```
$ rm -fr ~/.m2/repository/ar/nadezhda/*
```

Or do it manually, if you prefer.

> __NOTE:__ If you wish to import this project in _Eclipse IDE_, you should
> install the [m2e-apt](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/m2e-apt)
> plugin. This way, _Dagger_ will compile the modules and components
> automatically.

## Execution

In the root folder, type:

```
$ java -jar vortex.jar <mode>
```

Where _\<mode\>_ can be:

* `simulation`: Runs a complete simulation of the specified system in
configuration.

If you want to change the logging mechanism, simply call the application with:

```
$ java -Dlogback.configurationFile=logback.xml -jar vortex.jar <mode>
```

Where `logback.xml` is the configuration file. You can change this and use
whatever other file you want. By default, _Vortex_ will log to the console.

## Configuration

The configuration must be in a file named `vortex.json`, located in the root
folder. It must contain the following properties:

```
{
}
```

## Libraries

This application uses these _Java_ libraries to complete its task:

* __[Dagger v2.16](https://google.github.io/dagger/)__: As the fully static DI
framework.
* __[Jackson v2.9.6](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)__: For reading the
JSON configuration.

## Designer

This project has been built, designed and maintained by:

* [Agust√≠n Golmar](https://github.com/agustin-golmar)
